AWS Systems Manager for SAP also now supports highly available SAP HANA deployments.AWS Systems Manager is a secure end-to-end management solution for resources on AWS. Application Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, helps DevOps engineers investigate and remediate issues with their AWS resources in the context of their applications and clusters. AWS Systems Manager for SAP helps AWS services understand SAP specific nuances around landscape topology and discover the components of an SAP landscape, such the SAP NetWeaver application server, SAP HANA database, and their interdependencies. It provides automation capabilities to help customers manage and operate their SAP applications on AWS more efficiently. This enables customers to capture specific metadata via registration and reflect system state before and after execution of workload automation. Further, customers can record evidence that an operational activities have been performed properly. With this launch, customers can use Systems Manager Application Manager to register their SAP HANA systems (single node and Highly Available) using Application Manager console. Once registered, these HANA databases (single node) can be managed by AWS Backup to backup and restore the systems. AWS Systems Manager for SAP is available in all commercial regions.
