# Adaptive Agentic Intelligence Framework (AAIF) - v1.0

An innovative architecture framework I propose to demonstrate **"Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI"** (NVIDIA Research) through intelligent adaptive AI orchestration across any deployment scenario. This code example showcases what you can build with the framework, starting with IoT monitoring that scales from edge to cloud.

**Powered by [Strands Agents](https://strands.ai)** - A production-ready agentic AI framework for building intelligent applications.

## Framework Overview

I propose the **Adaptive Agentic Intelligence Framework (AAIF)** as an architecture framework for building intelligent AI applications using Strands Agents. This code example demonstrates the framework's capabilities through IoT monitoring, but AAIF can be adapted to any deployment scenario and domain requiring intelligent AI model orchestration:

🎯 **Adaptive Processing:** Local monitoring + analysis (fast, private, cost-effective)  
☁️ **Selective Scaling:** Expert insights and complex analysis (only when justified)  
🧠 **Smart Orchestration:** Automatically routes requests to optimal AI models (powered by Strands)  
🔧 **Deployment Agnostic:** Works in cloud, edge, or hybrid environments  
⚡ **Enterprise Ready:** Built on Strands Agents for production deployment across any infrastructure

**Key Insight:** The same intelligence patterns work whether you're deploying on edge devices, cloud infrastructure, or hybrid environments.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install strands-agents ollama boto3
```

### 2. Setup Local AI (Ollama) - Optional but Recommended
```bash
# Install and start Ollama for local deployment
ollama serve

# Install required models for local processing
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
ollama pull llama3.2-vision
```

**Framework Flexibility:** This demo uses Ollama for local processing, but AAIF supports any deployment pattern:
- **☁️ Cloud-First:** Replace Ollama with cloud APIs (Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, etc.)  
- **🔄 Hybrid:** Combine local specialized models with cloud generalists  
- **🏠 Edge-Native:** Deploy completely offline with local models  
- **💰 Cost-Optimized:** Mix free/low-cost local models with selective premium API calls  

```python
model = OllamaModel(
    model_id="llama3.2:1b",
    host="http://localhost:11434",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 300,
        "temperature": 0.3,
        "stream": False,
    },
)

agent = Agent(
    model=model,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    tools=[
        get_device_telemetry,
        analyze_camera_feed,
        get_expert_insights,
    ],
)
```

### 3. Configure Cloud AI (Optional)
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS credentials for Bedrock access
```

### 4. Add Sample Images
Place image files in the same directory as the script:
- `factory_floor.jpg`
- `sample_image.png`

### 5. Run AAIF Demo
```bash
# Check prerequisites
python adaptive_ai_demo.py --check

# Run automated demo
python adaptive_ai_demo.py

# Interactive mode
python adaptive_ai_demo.py --interactive
```

## Demo Examples
