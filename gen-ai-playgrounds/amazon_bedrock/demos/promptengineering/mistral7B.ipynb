    "In a microservices architecture, software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These small components are divided so that each of them does one thing, and does it well, while cooperating to deliver a full-featured application. An analogy can be drawn to the Walkman portable audio cassette players that were popular in the 1980s: batteries bring power, audio tapes are the medium, headphones deliver output, while the main tape player takes input through key presses. Using them together plays music. Similarly, microservices need to be decoupled, and each should focus on one functionality. Additionally, a microservices architecture allows for replacement or upgrade. Using the Walkman analogy, if the headphones are worn out, you can replace them without replacing the tape player. If an order management service in our store-keeping application is falling behind and performing too slowly, you can swap it for a more performant, more streamlined component. Such a permutation would not affect or interrupt other microservices in the system.\n",
